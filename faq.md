## General Information

### What are mobile modular buildings?
Mobile modular buildings are pre-constructed, transportable structures designed for temporary or permanent use. They're built in climate-controlled facilities using the same materials and standards as traditional construction, then transported to your site for immediate occupancy.

### How do mobile modular buildings differ from traditional construction?
Mobile modular buildings are constructed off-site in controlled factory conditions, allowing for faster deployment (7-14 days vs. 6-18 months), lower costs (40-60% savings), and consistent quality control. They meet the same building codes as permanent construction.

### What industries use mobile modular buildings?
Mobile modular buildings serve education (classrooms), healthcare (medical facilities), construction (site offices), government (emergency operations), retail/commercial (stores and offices), restaurants (commercial kitchens), and many other industries.

### Are mobile modular buildings permanent or temporary?
Mobile modular buildings can serve both purposes. They can be temporarily installed for specific projects or events, or permanently installed as long-term facilities. Many customers start with temporary installations and later purchase for permanent use.

### What sizes and configurations are available?
Buildings range from small single units (6' x 8' guard stations) to large complexes (60' x 100'+ multi-building campuses). Standard single units are typically 12'-24' wide and 20'-60' long, with custom configurations available for larger needs.

## Costs and Financing

### How much do mobile modular buildings cost?
Rental rates start at $300/month for basic units and range to $2,500/month for specialized facilities. Purchase prices range from $15,000 for small units to $200,000+ for large, specialized buildings. Costs depend on size, features, and customization.

### What financing options are available?
We offer rental (1 month minimum), long-term leases (multi-year terms), lease-to-own programs, and traditional purchase with financing. Educational institutions, government agencies, and businesses qualify for specialized financing programs.

### Are there additional costs beyond the building price?
Additional costs may include delivery and installation ($2,000-$8,000), site preparation ($1,000-$5,000), utility connections ($1,500-$6,000), permits ($500-$3,000), and optional furniture/technology packages ($5,000-$25,000).

### How do costs compare to permanent construction?
Mobile modular buildings typically cost 40-60% less than permanent construction when including time savings, reduced financing costs, and avoided construction delays. They also provide immediate occupancy and flexibility for changing needs.

### Can I rent first and then purchase?
Yes, many customers start with rental arrangements and later purchase their buildings. Rental payments can often be applied toward purchase price in rent-to-own programs, and we offer upgrade paths from rental to ownership.

## Timeline and Deployment

### How quickly can buildings be delivered and installed?
Standard configurations can be delivered and installed within 7-14 days of order confirmation. Custom buildings typically require 3-4 weeks. Emergency deployments can be coordinated within 24-48 hours for critical needs.

### What factors affect delivery timeline?
Timeline depends on building availability, customization requirements, site preparation needs, permit approval processes, and weather conditions. Distance from manufacturing facilities and local delivery schedules also impact timing.

### Can buildings be installed year-round?
Yes, buildings can be installed in most weather conditions. Extreme weather (ice storms, severe winds) may cause temporary delays, but installations typically proceed year-round with appropriate safety precautions.

### How long does installation take?
Installation typically takes 1-3 days depending on building size and complexity. Single units can often be installed in one day, while multi-building complexes may require several days for complete setup and utility connections.

### What site preparation is required?
Sites need level ground, adequate drainage, and access for delivery vehicles. We can provide site preparation services or work with your contractors. Utilities should be available at the site boundary or can be provided through temporary systems.
